# Intro

This project template builds on the deployment principles described in `python_app_to_k8s` by automating them with GitHub actions. 

Notes:

> On push to any branch, want to run unit tests
> On merge to main, want to build docker image, push to ecr and deploy to k8s. also configure cronjob
